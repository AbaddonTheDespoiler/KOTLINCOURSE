### Task 1. Rewrite address book
Rewrite the application so the application asks the user for a command. Either list the contents of the address book (list) or add users to the address book (add). Use a for each loop to list the users when the command is a 'list' command. Remember to just use (local) functions and variables, no classes or objects.
